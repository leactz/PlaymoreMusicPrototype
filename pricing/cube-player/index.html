<h4>The benefits of using a CUBE physical player:</h4>

      <figcaption>
        <p class="h5 text-left">There is always playback equipment involved. </p>
        <p>
          When you’re playing music at your store, there is always equipment responsible for doing the playback, outputting the audio signal into your amplifier and speakers. Either you’re using a physical player device, like CUBE, or you’re running software on a phone, tablet or computer. In any case, there is always some piece of equipment involved.

        <p class="h5 text-left">Streaming of music is not good for business.  </p>
        <p>
          When your music is being streamed over your internet connection, this can use as much as 100 times more bandwidth than a music solution which automatically stores the songs locally, able to use them again. Streaming can slow your network down, making other business functions (like processing of transactions) take longer! Also, when your internet has an outage, or is slow, your music will be interrupted.

        <p class="h5 text-left">Many online-only systems that claim they do not stream, are stretching the truth!</p>
        <p>
          Some online services claim that they store songs locally on your device, and therefore are not streaming. This is often stretching the truth very thinly! Especially when the service is playing the music from inside a web browser, the amount of space that it can use to store songs locally, is in fact very small: typically only enough for 5 to 10 songs. So either you are going to be listening to the same few songs over and over again; or the browser will secretly keep fetching every song every time that it is played: which is just a form of streaming.
        </p>

        <p class="h5 text-left">Those online-only mobile apps that actually do store songs locally, have a big downside.</p>
        <p>
          Say that you’re using an online service that really does store songs locally on your device. This means that you had to install software, like a special app, on your tablet, phone, PC or Mac.
          <br><br>
          Imagine you installed this onto your tablet. A good quality music program can easily use up 16GB of space. Or more, if you want to be able to change between programming locally. This can use up a significant portion of the storage you have available on your tablet or phone. You may not have space for much else!
          <br><br>
          Perhaps you might think that the program can be set up to use less space, or perhaps you can use an SD card to expand your tablet’s storage. However: the less space it uses, the more you are back to having a streaming system. And the more frequently the software has to change out songs on your tablet, the faster its storage memory will wear out. Yes, flash storage memory wears out, and your tablet will gradually get slower and slower because of this. If you’ve expanded its storage with the kinds of SD cards you can buy from computer stores, the SD card will wear out even faster than the tablet; and you’ll have to keep buying replacement cards.

          There is a hidden cost to using your tablet or phone device for business music playback. </p>
        <p>
          We have already discussed above how business music services that actually store songs locally can wear out your tablet or phone’s storage - and if they don’t store songs locally, you have all the problems that come with streaming.
          <br><br>
          Whether its a streaming or a storing system, you will probably need to leave your tablet or phone connected to power, so the battery remains charged all the time. This will wear the battery out faster. Also, you will discover that other things you want to use your tablet or phone for, are suddenly much more difficult, because your phone or tablet will no longer truly function as a mobile device.
          <br><br>
          As a result, you will probably need to buy another phone or tablet faster than you would have done otherwise. As we said earlier: when you play business music, there is always equipment playing the music, and that equipment is never free!
